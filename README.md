# EGM-Slider

This program uses a simulated sensor to adjust the height of an ABB robotic arm with Externally Guided Motion implemented. 
The robot moves in a square and the height is adjusted using a slider. The robot must be compatible with RobotWare 6.x.
All tests were done on an IRB140 industrial robotic arm. 

Program.cs is built upon the example code given by ABB

More information on Externally Guided Motion can be found in: Application manual - Controller software IRC5, which is a manual released by ABB.
